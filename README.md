### Connecting to Access Database on OSX

1. Get 3rd party ODBC driver here: http://www.cdata.com/drivers/access/download/odbc/
2. Install drivers
3. Edit c`data.odbc.access.ini` (for me this appeared here: `/Applications/CData ODBC Data for Access/lib/`)
4. Install pyodbc
5. Check that `test_odbc.py` displays some tables and rows.
